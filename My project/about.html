                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Bubaha's Farm started as a small family project with a straightforward goal: to breed robust, reliable livestock suited to our local climate and farming systems. Over the years we've grown our pastures, refined our breeding choices, and invested in on‑farm veterinary partnerships so customers can trust the animals they buy from us.</p>

                    <p>We balance traditional husbandry knowledge with modern herd-health practices — selecting breeding stock not only for appearance but for structural correctness, temperament, and functional performance. Our animals are raised on pasture, supplemented when necessary to support growth and breeding demands.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>Mission & Values</h3>
                    <p>Our mission is to support resilient local farming by providing quality rams that improve flock performance and farm profitability. We operate with transparency, offering clear health records and pedigree information where available. We value animal welfare, responsible breeding, and long‑term customer relationships.</p>

                    <h3>Breeding Program</h3>
                    <p>Rams are chosen for their conformation, temperament, and proven ability to sire healthy offspring. Each candidate goes through a selection process that includes structural assessment, temperament observation, and health screening. We track lineage and performance traits to make incremental genetic improvements across seasons.</p>

                    <h3>Health & Biosecurity</h3>
                    <p>Maintaining herd health is a top priority. We work with a local veterinarian to set vaccination schedules (including CDT where appropriate), perform routine parasite control, and implement hoof and dental care. Biosecurity measures are in place for visitors to prevent disease introduction; please arrange visits by appointment.</p>
